# Dockerizing a Full-Stack MERN Application

This project demonstrates the process of Dockerizing a full-stack MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) application. The application is divided into three main components: the front end (React), the back end (Express/Node.js), and the database (MongoDB). Docker and Docker Compose are used to containerize and orchestrate these components.
